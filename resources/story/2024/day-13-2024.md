# Day 13: Claw Contraption
Next up: the lobby of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles before spreading out.

Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new arcade! Maybe you can win some prizes from the claw machines?

The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled A and B. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs 3 tokens to push the A button and 1 token to push the B button.

With a little experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific amount to the right (along the X axis) and a specific amount forward (along the Y axis) each time that button is pressed.

Each machine contains one prize; to win the prize, the claw must be positioned exactly above the prize on both the X and Y axes.

You wonder: what is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible? You assemble a list of every machine's button behavior and prize location (your puzzle input). For example:
```
Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

Button A: X+26, Y+66
Button B: X+67, Y+21
Prize: X=12748, Y=12176

Button A: X+17, Y+86
Button B: X+84, Y+37
Prize: X=7870, Y=6450

Button A: X+69, Y+23
Button B: X+27, Y+71
Prize: X=18641, Y=10279
```

This list describes the button configuration and prize location of four different claw machines.

For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:
- Pushing the machine's A button would move the claw 94 units along the X axis and 34 units along the Y axis.
- Pushing the B button would move the claw 22 units along the X axis and 67 units along the Y axis.
- The prize is located at X=8400, Y=5400; this means that from the claw's initial position, it would need to move exactly 8400 units along the X axis and exactly 5400 units along the Y axis to be perfectly aligned with the prize in this machine.

The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 80 times and the B button 40 times. This would line up the claw along the X axis (because 80*94 + 40*22 = 8400) and along the Y axis (because 80*34 + 40*67 = 5400). Doing this would cost 80*3 tokens for the A presses and 40*1 for the B presses, a total of 280 tokens.

For the second and fourth claw machines, there is no combination of A and B presses that will ever win a prize.

For the third claw machine, the cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 38 times and the B button 86 times. Doing this would cost a total of 200 tokens.

So, the most prizes you could possibly win is two; the minimum tokens you would have to spend to win all (two) prizes is 480.

You estimate that each button would need to be pressed no more than 100 times to win a prize. How else would someone be expected to play?

*Figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?*


## Part Two
As you go to win the first prize, you discover that the claw is nowhere near where you expected it would be. Due to a unit conversion error in your measurements, the position of every prize is actually `10000000000000` higher on both the `X` and `Y` axis!

Add `10000000000000` to the `X` and `Y` position of every prize. After making this change, the example above would now look like this:

```
Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=10000000008400, Y=10000000005400

Button A: X+26, Y+66
Button B: X+67, Y+21
Prize: X=10000000012748, Y=10000000012176

Button A: X+17, Y+86
Button B: X+84, Y+37
Prize: X=10000000007870, Y=10000000006450

Button A: X+69, Y+23
Button B: X+27, Y+71
Prize: X=10000000018641, Y=10000000010279
```

Now, it is only possible to win a prize on the second and fourth claw machines. Unfortunately, it will take *many more than 100 presses* to do so.

*Using the corrected prize coordinates, figure out how to win as many prizes as possible. What is the fewest tokens you would have to spend to win all possible prizes?*

17a = 7870 - 84b

### LLM questions
Question:
Imagine I have the following equasion: 94a = 8400 - 22b. How can i find out possible values for a and b?

ChatGPT said:
To solve the equation `94a=8400−22b` for possible integer values of `a` and `b`, you can rearrange and analyze it for values that satisfy both sides.
Steps:
1. Rearrange the equation: `94a+22b=8400`
2. Solve for `b` in terms of `a`:
    ```
        8400 - 94a
    b = ----------
            22
    ```
3. To find valid `a` and `b` values, `b` must be an integer. For `b` to be an integer, `8400−94a` must be divisible by `22`. Thus: `(8400−94a) mod 22 = 0`
4. Iterate over possible `a` values and check which ones yield valid `b`.

Here's the Python implementation:
```py
def find_possible_values():
    results = []
    for a in range(-100, 1000):  # Adjust range as needed
        # Check if b is an integer
        if (8400 - 94 * a) % 22 == 0:
            b = (8400 - 94 * a) // 22
            results.append((a, b))
    return results

# Find and print possible values
possible_values = find_possible_values()
print("Possible (a, b) values:")
for a, b in possible_values:
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
```

Explanation
1. Range for a: You can adjust the range based on your problem context. Here, we test from -100 to 1000.
2. Divisibility check: Ensures bb is an integer by checking the modulus condition.
3. Result: Lists all pairs (a,b)(a,b) that satisfy the equation.

Question:
how do i determine the minimum range for a?

ChatGPT said:
To determine the minimum range for `a` in the equation `94a+22b=8400`, you need to establish bounds that guarantee all integer solutions for `b`. Here's how:
**Rearrange the Equation**:
1. Solve for `b`:
    ```
        8400 - 94a
    b = ----------
            22
    ```
2. For `b` to be an integer, `8400−94a` must be divisible by `22`: `(8400−94a) mod 22 = 0`

**Minimize the Range of a**:
1. `a` should be chosen such that:
    - `94a≤8400` (since both terms must balance).
    - `8400−94a≥0` (to keep bb non-negative, if required).
2. Rearrange these inequalities:
    ```
         8400
    a <= ----
          94
    a≥0(if only positive values are needed for a).
    ```
3. Compute the valid range for `a`:
    - The smallest `a` is `0` (or less, if negative solutions are considered).
    - The largest `a` is `⌊8400/94⌋=89`.

Thus, aa is in the range [0,89] (or wider if negatives are allowed).
Python Code to Automate:
```py
def find_minimum_range():
    a_min = 0  # Start at 0 (adjust if negatives are allowed)
    a_max = 8400 // 94  # Integer division
    possible_a = []
    
    for a in range(a_min, a_max + 1):
        if (8400 - 94 * a) % 22 == 0:
            possible_a.append(a)
    
    return min(possible_a), max(possible_a)

a_range = find_minimum_range()
print(f"The minimum range for a is: {a_range}")
```

Explanation:
1. Compute the upper limit for aa using 8400/948400/94.
2. Check all values of aa in this range to see if they yield integer bb values.
3. Return the smallest and largest valid aa.

Question:
the number is actually quite large instead of 8400, it would be 10000000008400. now my program takes too long to determine possible results. i now the max range of a, but how do i determine the minimum? Counting upwards from 0 is not good.

ChatGPT said:
To efficiently determine the minimum value of aa without iterating upwards from 00, you can take advantage of modular arithmetic. Here's the revised approach:

**Problem Recap**
The equation is: `94a+22b=10000000008400`
Rewriting for divisibility: `(10000000008400−94a) mod 22 = 0`

**Key Insight**
- Instead of iterating from 0, directly find the first value of a that satisfies the divisibility condition.
- Rearrange the equation: `94a ≡ 10000000008400 (mod22)`

**Steps to Find Minimum a**
1. Simplify the modulus operation:
    - Compute 94mod  2294mod22, which simplifies to 66 (since 94=4×22+694=4×22+6).
    - Reduce 10000000008400mod  2210000000008400mod22, which is a much smaller number.
2. Solve the modular congruence: `6a ≡ (10000000008400 mod 22) (mod22)`
3. Use the result to calculate a:
    - Start from the largest possible a (known max range) and work backward.

Here’s how to implement this efficiently in Python:
Python Code
```py
def find_minimum_a(large_number, max_a):
    # Constants
    mod_value = 22
    multiplier = 94

    # Step 1: Reduce the large number modulo mod_value
    target_remainder = large_number % mod_value

    # Step 2: Compute the remainder of multiplier mod mod_value
    multiplier_remainder = multiplier % mod_value

    # Step 3: Find the smallest a satisfying the modular equation
    for a in range(max_a, -1, -1):  # Start from max_a and move downward
        if (multiplier_remainder * a) % mod_value == target_remainder:
            return a

    return None  # If no solution is found (should not happen with valid inputs)

# Example usage
large_number = 10000000008400
max_a = 10000000008400 // 94  # Calculate max_a
min_a = find_minimum_a(large_number, max_a)
print(f"The minimum value of a is: {min_a}")
```

**Explanation of the Code**
1. Modular Reduction:
    - Reducing the large number modulo 22 drastically simplifies the computation.
    - Similarly, reducing 94 mod 22 (to 6) avoids large multiplications.
2. Backwards Search:
    - Start from the largest possible a (max range) and work backward.
    - This ensures you quickly find the minimum a without iterating upwards from 0.
3. Efficiency:
    - Reduces complexity from iterating through all possible a values to a backward search within a much smaller space.

Question:
actually for the following equasion 17a = 7870 - 84b, your example method, would give me a larger result for a then 38, which is also a valid result (b would be 86). What am i doing wrong?

ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see the issue. The problem lies in the modular arithmetic approach and how it identifies solutions. When solving 17a=7870−84b17a=7870−84b, the modular arithmetic solution might not find all valid smaller solutions for aa due to how modular equivalences work. Specifically, it's not enough to just solve the modulus equation — we also need to systematically reduce aa to its minimum valid value while ensuring bb remains an integer.

**Revised Approach**
Equation Setup:
17a+84b=7870

Rewriting for bb:
  7870−17a84
b=----------
  847870−17a​

For b to be an integer:
7870−17a mod 84 = 0

Modular Arithmetic:
The above modular condition ensures that 17a≡7870(mod84). However, this does not directly give the minimum aa unless we explore all congruent values for aa modulo 84/gcd(17,84).

Correct Minimum a Search:
To find all valid aa values:
1. Solve the congruence 17a≡7870(mod84)17a≡7870(mod84) using the extended Euclidean algorithm or modular inverses.
2. Find one solution a0a0​ that satisfies the congruence.
3. Generate all equivalent aa values by:
                   84
    a = a0 + k⋅ ------------
                gcd(17,84)​
    where kk is any integer.
4. Filter for the smallest aa that ensures bb is non-negative.

**Python Implementation**:
Here’s how to ensure the minimum aa is found:
```py
from math import gcd

def extended_gcd(a, b):
    """Returns gcd, x, y where gcd = ax + by."""
    if b == 0:
        return a, 1, 0
    g, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
    x = y1
    y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
    return g, x, y

def find_minimum_a():
    # Equation parameters
    A = 17  # Coefficient of a
    B = 84  # Coefficient of b
    C = 7870  # Constant term

    # Step 1: Solve 17a ≡ 7870 (mod 84)
    g, x, y = extended_gcd(A, B)
    if C % g != 0:
        raise ValueError("No solution exists")  # Check if solvable

    # Scale solution to match C
    x *= C // g
    mod = B // g

    # Step 2: Find the smallest non-negative a
    a = x % mod
    if a < 0:
        a += mod

    # Step 3: Verify b is an integer
    b = (C - A * a) // B
    while b < 0:  # Check for smaller solutions by reducing a
        a += mod
        b = (C - A * a) // B

    return a, b

# Example usage
a, b = find_minimum_a()
print(f"The minimum value of a is: {a}, with b = {b}")
```

Explanation of the Code:
1. Extended GCD:
    - Solves the modular equation 17a≡7870(mod84)17a≡7870(mod84) efficiently, finding a single solution and its modular step.

2. General Solutions:
    - Generates all possible values of aa by stepping through multiples of the modular base (84/gcd⁡(17,84)84/gcd(17,84)).

3. Filter for Minimum:
    - Adjusts aa to ensure bb remains an integer and non-negative.

**Why Does This Work Better?**
Unlike a simple modular arithmetic approach, this explicitly ensures bb is valid and finds the smallest aa through systematic exploration of congruent values.
